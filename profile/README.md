Every so often, I do some spring cleaning on my [github profile](https://github.com/mournfully) and I tend to transfer repositories here for a variaty of reasons...
- if a repo is really old and hasn't been worked on in a while
- if i'm no longer interested in whatever i was working on
- if a repo was temporarily made to test something
- if a project was a terrible idea and a waste of time 

It seems to make it much easier to focus on the projects that actually matter to me, if I have former projects moved off of my main github and laptop to someplace out of the way `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
