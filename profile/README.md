I don't want old projects that I don't care about anymore cluttering up my laptop or my github, but I also don't want to delete them or not be able to edit them - so i just throw them all in here with zero afterthought `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Btw, I would highly recommend not bothering with the projects in this organization as most of them tend to be broken or serve no real purpose anymore. Maybe take a look at my actual [github](https://github.com/mournfully) if you're interested or idk do literally anything else.
